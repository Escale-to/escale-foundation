# Escale

***A slow digital postcard system***

## What is Escale?

Escale is an open-source project exploring a different relationship with digital communication.

Instead of instant delivery, Escale allows messages to **take time**.  
A message does not simply appear.  
It departs, travels, and arrives.

Time, distance, and journey are not side effects.  
They are part of the experience.

---

## Why Escale?

Modern digital communication is fast, efficient, and constant.  
But speed is not always meaningful.

Some messages deserve anticipation.  
Some moments deserve delay.  
Some arrivals deserve to feel like events.

Escale exists to make space for those messages.

## Core Principles

- **Intentional delay**  
  Messages take time by design.

- **Visible journey**  
  Travel and progression are part of the narrative.

- **Calm experience**  
  No urgency, no pressure, no constant notifications.

- **Respect for attention and privacy**  
  Minimal data, minimal signals, maximum intention.

- **Open source by principle**  
  Transparency and clarity over opacity.

---

## What Escale Is Not

- Not an instant messaging platform  
- Not a productivity or efficiency tool  
- Not a social network  
- Not designed for urgency or constant engagement  

Escale complements existing tools.  
It does not replace them.

## Closing Note

Escale is not about slowing technology.  
It is about slowing interaction where speed has lost meaning.

Some messages are worth the wait.
