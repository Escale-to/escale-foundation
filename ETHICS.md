# Ethical and Philosophical Commitment

Escale is an open-source project,  
but it is not value-neutral.

This document expresses the ethical and philosophical commitments
that guide the development, use, and evolution of the project.

It does not replace the software license.
It complements it.

This document is not a marketing statement but a constraint framework.

---

## Purpose Before Power

Escale exists to restore meaning to digital communication.

Its purpose is not to optimize speed, engagement, or productivity,
but to create space for intentional, slower interactions.

Any use or extension of Escale that contradicts this purpose
undermines the spirit of the project.

---

## Respect for Time and Attention

Escale treats time as a value, not as friction.

The project must not be used to:

- create artificial urgency,
- pressure users into constant interaction,
- exploit attention through notifications or behavioral loops.

Waiting is intentional.
Arrival is meaningful.

---

## Privacy by Default

Escale is designed to minimize data collection.

Traceability exists to support narrative and experience,
not surveillance or control.

Any implementation that introduces tracking,
profiling, or behavioral monitoring
violates the ethical foundations of the project.

---

## No Manipulative Design

Escale rejects manipulative design practices, including:

- dark patterns,
- engagement hooks,
- infinite feedback loops,
- artificial scarcity or urgency.

Design choices must prioritize clarity, calm, and respect.

---

## Openness with Responsibility

Being open source does not imply openness to all uses.

The maintainers of Escale reserve the right
to refuse contributions or associations
that conflict with these ethical commitments.

Technical excellence alone is not sufficient.
Alignment with intention is required.

---

## Cultural Reference, Not Legal Constraint

This document is not a legal contract.

It is a cultural and philosophical reference,
intended to guide contributors, users, and maintainers
in preserving the integrity of the project.

Those who choose to use or contribute to Escale
are invited to respect not only the license,
but the intention behind it.

---

## Closing Statement

Escale is not about slowing technology.

It is about slowing interaction
where speed has erased meaning.

Integrity is not optional.
