## Preamble

In a world where communication has become instantaneous, constant, and almost weightless,  
messages arrive faster than they can be felt.

Speed has become the default.  
Waiting has become a flaw.  
Arrival has lost its meaning.

**Escale was born from a simple observation:**  
some messages deserve time.

Not because technology cannot deliver them instantly,  
but because meaning often emerges through distance, movement, and anticipation.

Escale proposes a different relationship with digital communication.  
It does not seek to optimize speed, engagement, or volume.  
Instead, it introduces intentional delay, simulated travel, and narrative traceability into the act of sending a message.

A message sent through Escale does not simply appear.  
It departs.  
It travels.  
It encounters distance.  
And only then does it arrive.

This document defines the founding vision of Escale.  
It does not describe a product roadmap, nor a technical implementation.  
It establishes an intention:  
to reintroduce time, place, and journey into digital correspondence.

Escale is not designed to compete with instant messaging platforms.  
It exists alongside them, as a slower, quieter alternative.

---

## Chapter 1 — Origin of the Project

The origin of Escale is not technological.
It is experiential.

The project emerged from a growing discomfort with the way digital communication has evolved:
messages are sent instantly, received instantly, and forgotten just as quickly.
The act of sending has lost its weight, and the act of receiving has lost its significance.

While physical postcards, letters, and parcels once carried distance, time, and uncertainty,
their digital equivalents have reduced communication to immediacy and efficiency alone.

Escale was conceived as a response to this imbalance.

Rather than attempting to replicate the physical postcard in a purely digital form,
the project asks a different question:

*What if time itself became part of the message?*

The initial intuition was simple:
a message does not need to arrive immediately to be meaningful.
In some cases, delay enhances intention, anticipation, and emotional resonance.

From this intuition emerged the idea of a digital postcard that travels.
Not metaphorically, but visibly.
A message that departs from a place, follows a route, progresses over time, and arrives only after completing its journey.

The concept of travel is not treated as decoration.
It is structural.
Distance determines duration.
Movement creates anticipation.
Arrival regains its value.

Escale was therefore designed not as a messaging tool,
but as a communication experience where time, geography, and narrative are inseparable from the content itself.

This project does not aim to replace existing communication platforms.
It exists as an alternative path — slower, intentional, and deliberate —
for moments that deserve to be marked, remembered, or felt differently.

The following chapters build upon this origin,
clarifying the intention, values, and conceptual framework that guide Escale as a long-term project.

---

## Chapter 2 — Intention & Philosophy

Escale is guided by a deliberate intention:
to reintroduce time as a meaningful dimension of digital communication.

The project does not view slowness as a limitation,
but as a design choice.
A conscious refusal of immediacy when immediacy no longer serves meaning.

In most digital systems, speed is treated as an absolute virtue.
Messages are optimized to arrive as quickly as possible,
often without regard for context, distance, or emotional weight.
Escale challenges this assumption.

The philosophy of Escale is based on a simple principle:
**a message can gain value by taking time to arrive.**

Waiting is not considered friction.
It is part of the experience.
Anticipation becomes a form of attention.
Arrival becomes a moment, not a notification.

Escale introduces delay not as an obstacle,
but as an intentional component of communication.
Time is neither hidden nor minimized;
it is visible, traceable, and meaningful.

The journey of a message is as important as its content.
Movement through space creates narrative.
Progress through time creates expectation.
Together, they transform a message into an event.

This philosophy implies restraint.
Escale avoids constant stimulation, excessive feedback, and artificial urgency.
It favors calm interfaces, minimal interactions, and rare but significant signals.

The project is not designed to maximize engagement, frequency, or retention metrics.
Its success is measured differently:
by the quality of attention it invites,
and by the intention behind each message sent.

Escale embraces a slower digital rhythm.
One that aligns more closely with human perception, memory, and emotion.
In doing so, it proposes a quiet alternative to the dominant paradigms of instant communication.

This philosophy informs every aspect of the project —
from language and interaction to design choices and future evolution.
It is not a constraint, but an anchor.

---

## Chapter 3 — The Problem Addressed

Modern digital communication is built around a single dominant objective: immediacy.

Messages are delivered instantly, regardless of distance, context, or intention.
This efficiency has enabled unprecedented connectivity,
but it has also reshaped the way communication is perceived and experienced.

In an environment of constant availability, messages compete for attention rather than meaning.
The ease of sending has reduced the weight of the act itself.
The speed of delivery has diminished the significance of arrival.

As a result, many digital interactions become ephemeral.
They are read quickly, reacted to immediately, and forgotten shortly thereafter.
Time, once an integral part of communication, has been removed from the equation.

Physical forms of correspondence — letters, postcards, parcels —
naturally embedded delay, uncertainty, and distance.
These constraints created anticipation, emotional investment, and memory.
Their digital counterparts have largely eliminated these dimensions.

Attempts to digitize postcards or greetings often focus on visual effects, animations, or instant delivery.
While aesthetically engaging, these approaches preserve the same underlying assumption:
that faster is always better.

Escale identifies this assumption as the core problem.

The issue is not technological limitation,
but a lack of intentionality in how time is treated within digital communication systems.

When every message arrives instantly,
there is no distinction between what is urgent and what is meaningful.
When arrival is guaranteed and immediate,
there is no space for anticipation or narrative.

Escale addresses this gap by reintroducing delay as a first-class concept.
Not as an artificial restriction,
but as a deliberate design choice that restores balance between speed and significance.

By making time visible and meaningful again,
Escale seeks to create a form of communication where messages are not merely transmitted,
but experienced.

This problem definition serves as the foundation for the vision and structure described in the following chapters.

---

## Chapter 4 — Vision of Escale

The vision of Escale extends beyond a single application or use case.
It proposes a different relationship with digital communication,
one in which time, distance, and intention are treated as essential elements rather than obstacles.

Escale envisions a digital environment where not all messages are equal.
Some are immediate.
Others are meant to travel.

In this vision, Escale becomes a space for messages that matter.
Messages sent to mark a moment,
to acknowledge distance,
or to create anticipation rather than interruption.

The project aims to establish a new category of communication:
neither instant messaging nor traditional correspondence,
but a hybrid form where digital convenience coexists with temporal depth.

Over time, Escale is intended to evolve into a universal medium for intentional messages.
A platform where geography is visible,
where journeys are traceable,
and where arrival carries meaning because it was not immediate.

This vision does not depend on scale or volume.
Escale is not designed to handle every conversation,
nor to replace existing tools.
Its relevance lies in its selectivity.

By remaining focused on deliberate communication,
Escale seeks to preserve clarity and coherence as it grows.
New features, formats, or use cases are considered only insofar as they reinforce the core principle:
that time is not an inconvenience, but a value.

Ultimately, Escale aspires to become a reference point.
A quiet alternative within the digital landscape,
recognized not by its speed or visibility,
but by the depth of experience it offers.

This vision guides all future decisions,
ensuring that evolution never compromises the intention established at the origin of the project.

---

## Chapter 5 — What Escale Is / What Escale Is Not

Clarity of intention requires clear boundaries.
This chapter defines what Escale deliberately chooses to be,
and what it intentionally refuses to become.

These distinctions are essential to preserve coherence as the project evolves.

### What Escale Is

**Escale is a communication experience.**
It is designed around the idea that sending a message can be a meaningful act,
not a reflex.

**Escale is intentional.**
Messages are sent with purpose,
often for moments that deserve attention, memory, or distance.

**Escale is temporal.**
Time is not hidden or minimized.
It is visible, assumed, and integrated into the experience.

**Escale is narrative.**
A message departs, travels, progresses, and arrives.
Its journey is part of its meaning.

**Escale is calm by design.**
Interfaces are restrained.
Interactions are minimal.
Signals are rare but significant.

**Escale is open and transparent.**
Its principles are readable.
Its intentions are explicit.
Its foundations are open to inspection and contribution.

**Escale is complementary.**
It exists alongside instant communication tools,
serving moments that require a different rhythm.

### What Escale Is Not

**Escale is not an instant messaging platform.**
It does not aim to replace real-time conversation
or compete on speed.

**Escale is not a productivity tool.**
It does not optimize efficiency, throughput, or response time.

**Escale is not a social network.**
It does not seek visibility, virality, or continuous engagement.

**Escale is not a notification-driven system.**
It avoids constant prompts, alerts, and attention capture.

**Escale is not entertainment through excess.**
Animations, visuals, and effects exist only to support meaning,
never to distract from it.

**Escale is not urgency-oriented.**
There is no pressure to respond,
no expectation of immediacy,
and no penalty for waiting.

### A Deliberate Position

By defining these boundaries,
Escale protects its core philosophy.

These distinctions are not limitations.
They are commitments.

They ensure that as the project grows,
its evolution remains aligned with the intention established at its origin:
to treat time not as an inconvenience,
but as an essential part of meaningful communication.

---

## Chapter 6 — Brand DNA & Core Values

The identity of Escale is not defined by features or technology,
but by a set of principles that guide every decision, interaction, and evolution of the project.

These elements form the core of Escale’s brand DNA.

---

### Brand DNA

At its core, Escale is defined by the following characteristics:

**Calm**
Escale operates at a slower rhythm.
It avoids urgency, noise, and visual aggression.

**Intentional**
Every action within Escale is deliberate.
Sending a message is a choice, not a reflex.

**Narrative**
Messages are not static objects.
They move, progress, and unfold over time.

**Respectful**
Escale respects attention, privacy, and emotional space.
It does not demand constant interaction.

**Timeless**
The project avoids trends and short-lived design patterns.
Its identity is meant to remain relevant beyond technological cycles.

### Core Values

#### 1. Time as Value

Time is not a cost to minimize.
It is a meaningful component of communication.

#### 2. Restraint over Abundance

Less interaction creates more significance.
Escale favors clarity over saturation.

#### 3. Meaning over Metrics

Success is not measured by engagement frequency or volume,
but by the intention behind each message.

#### 4. Transparency and Openness

Escale is open by design.
Its foundations are visible, understandable, and shareable.

#### 5. Universality

The experience transcends language, culture, and geography.
A message that travels is a concept understood everywhere.

### Consistency Over Expansion

These values are not aspirational slogans.
They are operational constraints.

Any future feature, extension, or collaboration must align with this DNA.
If an evolution compromises these principles,
it does not belong in Escale.

This commitment to consistency ensures that the project remains coherent,
recognizable, and faithful to its original intention over time.

---

## Chapter 7 — Lexicon and Language

Language is not neutral.
The words used to describe an experience shape how it is perceived, understood, and remembered.

Escale adopts a deliberate lexicon that reflects its philosophy.
This language is not decorative.
It structures the experience and reinforces intention.

### A Purposeful Vocabulary

Escale avoids the conventional terminology of digital messaging systems.
Words associated with speed, efficiency, and immediacy are replaced by terms that emphasize movement, time, and journey.

This vocabulary creates a coherent narrative framework in which each message exists not as a data transfer, but as a traveling object.

### Core Terminology

Within Escale, the following distinctions apply:

* A message is a **card**
  It is a discrete object, created with intention.

* A card is not sent; it **departs**
  Departure marks the beginning of a journey.

* A card does not transmit; it **travels**
  Movement through space and time is explicit.

* A delay is a **travel duration**
  Time is described as distance, not waiting.

* A card does not fail; it encounters a **countertime**
  Irregularities are framed as part of the journey.

* A card is not delivered; it **arrives**
  Arrival is an event, not a notification.

* A notification is a **signal**
  Rare, quiet, and meaningful.

This lexicon is applied consistently across interfaces, documentation, and communication.

### Tone and Expression

The language of Escale follows specific principles:

* Calm and composed.
* Simple and accessible.
* Free of urgency.
* Free of technical jargon when not strictly necessary.

Punctuation is restrained.
Exclamation marks are avoided.
Sentences favor clarity over emphasis.

### Narrative Consistency

Every word used within Escale must support the narrative of travel.

Interfaces do not instruct users to “send now” or “open immediately.”
They invite departure, observation, and arrival.

By maintaining this narrative consistency,
Escale ensures that language reinforces experience rather than contradicting it.

### Language as Structure

This lexicon is not fixed for stylistic reasons alone.
It acts as a structural constraint.

Any future feature or extension that cannot be described using this language
risks breaking the coherence of the project
and must be carefully reconsidered.

In Escale, language is not an afterthought.
It is a foundational component of the system.

---

## Chapter 8 — User Experience Principles

The user experience of Escale is not designed to optimize speed or frequency.
It is designed to support intention, calm, and attention.

Every interaction follows a small set of principles that ensure coherence between philosophy and experience.

### Simplicity Over Density

Escale favors simplicity at every level.
Interfaces are uncluttered.
Options are limited.
Choices are deliberate.

The goal is not to offer many possibilities,
but to ensure that each action carries meaning.

If an interaction does not contribute to intention or narrative,
it does not belong in the experience.

### Calm as a Design Constraint

Escale avoids visual and cognitive noise.

There are no aggressive colors,
no rapid transitions,
no sudden interruptions.

Motion is slow.
Feedback is subtle.
Silence is acceptable.

Calm is not an aesthetic choice.
It is a functional requirement.

### Intentional Actions

Actions within Escale are not designed to be instantaneous reflexes.

Creating a card, initiating a journey, or opening an arrival
are moments that invite awareness.

The experience encourages users to pause,
even briefly,
before acting.

This pause reinforces intention.

### Minimal Interaction, Maximum Meaning

Escale reduces interaction frequency.
It favors fewer actions with higher emotional value.

There is no pressure to check, refresh, or respond.
Progress is visible without demanding attention.

The experience respects the user’s time
by not constantly requesting it.

### Arrival as a Moment

Arrival is treated as a meaningful event.

Opening a card is never rushed.
It is framed as a moment of presence.

The experience avoids rewarding speed.
Instead, it acknowledges completion, distance, and patience.

### Consistency Over Novelty

Escale avoids novelty for its own sake.

Interactions remain predictable,
familiar,
and stable over time.

This consistency builds trust
and allows users to focus on meaning rather than learning mechanics.

### Experience as an Extension of Philosophy

User experience decisions are never isolated.
They reflect the project’s broader philosophy.

If a design choice contradicts the principles of calm, restraint, or intention,
it must be reconsidered, regardless of efficiency or trend.

In Escale, user experience is not a layer applied after functionality.
It is the visible expression of the project’s core values.

---

## Chapter 9 — Time, Travel, and Traceability

Time and travel are not metaphors in Escale.
They are structural elements of the experience.

Every card exists within a temporal and spatial context.
Its meaning is shaped not only by its content,
but by the journey it undertakes.

### Time as a Visible Dimension

In Escale, time is never abstract or hidden.

A card does not wait passively.
It progresses.

The passage of time is made visible through movement, distance, and duration.
Users are not presented with a countdown,
but with a sense of ongoing travel.

Time is framed as experience rather than delay.

### Travel as Narrative Structure

A card in Escale follows a journey.

This journey is not purely symbolic.
It is composed of departure, progression, and arrival.

Each phase contributes to the narrative of the message:

* Departure marks intention.
* Travel creates anticipation.
* Arrival gives closure.

The journey transforms a message into a story.

### Distance Determines Duration

Distance is not cosmetic.
It has consequence.

The farther a card travels,
the longer its journey takes.

This relationship reinforces the connection between geography and time,
restoring a sense of scale often lost in digital communication.

### Traceability Without Surveillance

Escale introduces traceability with restraint.

A card’s position and progression may be observed,
but never in a way that creates pressure, urgency, or control.

Traceability exists to support narrative and anticipation,
not to optimize performance or enforce expectations.

There are no real-time demands,
no delivery anxiety,
and no obligation to monitor progress.

### Irregularity as Part of the Journey

Journeys are not always linear.

In Escale, variation, pauses, and deviations are accepted.
They are framed as part of the experience rather than as errors.

This approach reinforces the idea that travel — and communication —
is not always predictable.

### Arrival as Completion

Arrival marks the conclusion of the journey.

It is not instantaneous.
It is not interruptive.

Arrival signifies that time has passed,
distance has been crossed,
and the message is now ready to be received.

This moment restores weight to reception
by acknowledging the path that preceded it.

### A Coherent Temporal System

Time, travel, and traceability form a unified system.

They are not features layered onto messaging,
but foundational principles that redefine how communication is experienced.

This system ensures that Escale remains distinct,
anchored in intention,
and resistant to the pressures of instant gratification.

---

## Chapter 10 — Conceptual Architecture

The architecture of Escale is conceptual before it is technical.

It defines how ideas relate to one another,
how experiences are structured,
and how meaning is preserved across time and evolution.

This architecture is intentionally abstract.
It establishes boundaries and relationships,
not implementations.

### Core Components

Escale is structured around a small number of conceptual components,
each with a distinct role.

#### The Card

The card is the fundamental unit of Escale.

It is a self-contained object that carries:

* content,
* intention,
* origin,
* destination,
* and a journey.

A card is created once,
then transformed through travel.

#### The Journey

The journey is the temporal and spatial path of the card.

It defines:

* duration,
* progression,
* and narrative context.

The journey is not optional.
A card without a journey does not exist within Escale.

#### Time

Time governs progression.

It is continuous, observable, and irreversible.
Once a journey begins, time moves forward.

Time cannot be skipped, accelerated, or bypassed
without breaking the integrity of the experience.

#### Space

Space provides scale and distance.

Geography is used to give meaning to duration,
not to enforce precision.

Space reinforces the relationship between place and communication.

#### Arrival

Arrival represents completion.

It is the moment where the card transitions
from traveling object
to receivable message.

Arrival concludes the narrative
without erasing the journey that preceded it.

### Separation of Concerns

Each component has a clear conceptual responsibility.

* Content does not control time.
* Time does not alter content.
* Travel does not depend on attention.
* Traceability does not imply control.

This separation preserves clarity
and prevents feature overlap from diluting intention.

### Extensibility Without Dilution

The conceptual architecture of Escale is designed to evolve.

New formats, layers, or representations may be introduced
only if they integrate naturally within this structure.

If a future addition cannot be expressed
in terms of card, journey, time, space, and arrival,
it risks compromising coherence.

### Architecture as Constraint

This conceptual architecture is not merely descriptive.
It is prescriptive.

It acts as a constraint system
that protects Escale from drifting toward immediacy,
excessive complexity,
or feature accumulation without purpose.

By anchoring development decisions in this structure,
Escale ensures that growth remains aligned
with the founding intention of the project.

---

## Chapter 11 — Open Source & Ethics

Escale is founded on the belief that trust is essential to meaningful communication.

This trust cannot be assumed.
It must be earned through transparency, restraint, and clear intent.

### Openness as a Principle

Escale adopts an open-source approach not as a distribution strategy,
but as an ethical position.

Openness allows the foundations of the project to be examined, understood, and questioned.
It ensures that the system does not rely on obscurity or hidden mechanisms.

The core concepts, intentions, and structures of Escale are meant to remain visible and readable.
This visibility reinforces trust and invites thoughtful contribution.

### Transparency Over Optimization

Escale does not prioritize opaque optimization, growth at any cost, or behavioral manipulation.

There are no hidden incentives,
no artificial urgency,
and no mechanisms designed to exploit attention.

Decisions that affect user experience, time, or visibility
must be explainable and justifiable.

If a behavior cannot be explained clearly,
it does not belong in the system.

### Respect for Privacy

Escale collects and exposes only what is necessary
to support the experience of travel and arrival.

Traceability is designed for narrative purposes,
not for monitoring or control.

There is no expectation of constant presence,
no obligation to respond,
and no pressure created by visibility.

Privacy is treated as a default state,
not as an optional feature.

### Ethical Restraint

Escale deliberately avoids mechanisms commonly used to maximize engagement:

* infinite feedback loops,
* attention hooks,
* urgency-driven signals.

The project acknowledges that not all growth is desirable,
and that some forms of restraint are necessary
to preserve meaning and coherence.

Ethical restraint is considered a design requirement,
not a limitation.

### Community and Contribution

Being open source does not imply openness to all directions.

Contributions are welcomed
when they align with the project’s intention, philosophy, and values.

Technical excellence alone is not sufficient.
Proposed changes must respect the conceptual and ethical framework defined in this document.

This ensures that collaboration strengthens the project
rather than diluting its purpose.

### Ethics as a Long-Term Commitment

Ethical considerations are not confined to the early stages of Escale.

As the project evolves,
new questions will emerge.

This chapter serves as a reference point
to guide future decisions
when trade-offs between convenience, scale, and integrity arise.

Escale chooses integrity.

---

## Chapter 12 — What Escale Enables

Escale does not prescribe how it should be used.
It provides a framework within which meaningful uses can emerge.

By reintroducing time, travel, and intention into digital communication,
Escale enables forms of expression that are difficult — or impossible —
within instant systems.

### Intentional Communication

Escale enables messages that are sent with purpose.

Messages meant to be felt rather than reacted to.
Messages chosen for their timing,
not their immediacy.

The act of sending becomes deliberate,
and reception becomes an experience rather than a reflex.

### Marking Moments

Escale enables communication that marks moments.

Not every message needs to arrive now.
Some are meant to arrive later —
to coincide with a date, a distance, or a passage of time.

By embedding delay into the message itself,
Escale allows moments to be acknowledged in a way that feels intentional and memorable.

### Acknowledging Distance

Escale enables a visible relationship with distance.

Geography is no longer abstract or erased.
It becomes part of the message’s meaning.

By making distance tangible,
Escale allows communication to reflect separation, travel, and absence
without attempting to erase them.

### Anticipation and Presence

Escale enables anticipation without anxiety.

Progress can be observed without urgency.
Waiting is framed as part of the experience,
not as a failure of delivery.

This anticipation invites presence,
both at departure and at arrival.

### Personal and Collective Use

Escale enables both personal and shared experiences.

A card may be sent to one person
or shared among several recipients.

In both cases, the journey remains central,
creating a shared temporal reference
that connects sender and receiver through the same passage of time.

### Reflection and Self-Address

Escale also enables communication with oneself.

Messages sent forward in time,
across distance or delay,
become tools for reflection rather than productivity.

This use reinforces the idea that Escale is not limited to interpersonal exchange,
but extends to personal narrative and memory.

### An Open Field of Meaning

These uses are not exhaustive.

Escale does not attempt to define all possible applications of its framework.
Instead, it creates conditions under which new, meaningful practices may emerge.

What Escale enables is not a set of features,
but a different relationship with communication itself.

---

## Chapter 13 — Future Evolutions

Escale is designed as a long-term project.

Its evolution is expected,
but it is not driven by novelty, expansion, or acceleration.

Change is approached with caution,
and only when it reinforces the project’s founding intention.

### Evolution Without Acceleration

Future developments may introduce new formats, representations, or layers of expression.
However, no evolution should compromise the central role of time, travel, and intention.

Speed, immediacy, and constant availability
are not goals to be optimized toward.

If a future change reduces waiting to a technical inconvenience,
or transforms arrival into a background event,
it conflicts with the core of Escale.

### Continuity of Meaning

Escale prioritizes continuity over disruption.

New capabilities must integrate naturally within the existing conceptual architecture.
They should extend the experience,
not redefine its purpose.

Evolution is measured by coherence,
not by quantity.

### Technological Independence

While Escale may adopt new technologies over time,
its identity is not bound to any specific platform, framework, or infrastructure.

Technological choices are considered tools,
not defining elements.

This independence ensures that Escale remains adaptable
without losing its conceptual foundation.

### Open Evolution

As an open-source project,
Escale invites exploration and contribution.

However, openness does not imply unrestricted change.

All evolutions must respect the principles, values, and boundaries
defined in this document.

When divergence occurs,
this document serves as the reference point
to evaluate alignment.

### A Stable Reference

This document is not meant to be rewritten with each iteration.

It establishes an origin,
an intention,
and a direction.

Future versions may clarify or expand upon these foundations,
but the core described here remains stable.

### Closing Statement

Escale is not an attempt to slow technology.
It is an attempt to slow interaction where speed has lost meaning.

By preserving time, travel, and intention as first-class elements,
Escale offers a quieter path within digital communication.

One where arrival still matters.

---

## Document Stability

This document serves as a stable conceptual reference.

It is not intended to evolve with each implementation detail or technical iteration.
Revisions may clarify or extend its content, but the founding intention defined here
must remain unchanged.

---

## Document Integrity

This document is versioned and timestamped through Git.

The authoritative reference for version 1.0
is the Git tag `v1.0`.

---

This foundational document intentionally refrains from defining certain aspects of the Escale project.

In particular, it does not specify:

* Any technical architecture, implementation details, or technology stack  
* Any product roadmap, delivery timeline, or release strategy  
* Any business model, monetization approach, or commercial positioning  
* Any governance structure, organizational form, or legal entity  
* Any usage metrics, growth objectives, or engagement targets  
* Any obligation to scale, optimize, or industrialize the project  

These elements are deliberately left undefined at this stage.

Escale is conceived as a long-term project whose technical, organizational, and economic expressions may evolve over time.  
Such decisions, when they become relevant, will be addressed in separate documents, at a later stage, and only if they remain aligned with the foundational intent expressed here.

This document defines *what Escale is* and *what it protects*, not *how it must be built*, *marketed*, or *expanded*.
