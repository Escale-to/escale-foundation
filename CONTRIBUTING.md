# Contributing to Escale

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Escale.

Escale is an open-source project, but it is not directionless.  
Contributions are welcome when they strengthen the project’s intention, coherence, and philosophy.

Before contributing, please take a moment to understand the project’s foundations.

---

## Read This First

Escale is guided by a clear conceptual framework.

Before proposing any change, you are expected to read:

📘 `FOUNDATION.md`

This document defines:

- the project’s intention,
- its philosophy,
- its boundaries,
- and what Escale deliberately chooses *not* to become.

Contributions that conflict with these principles will not be accepted, regardless of technical quality.

---

## What We Welcome

We welcome contributions that:

- Reinforce the core concepts of time, travel, and intention
- Improve clarity, calmness, or coherence
- Simplify without reducing meaning
- Enhance accessibility without introducing urgency
- Respect privacy, restraint, and transparency
- Align with the project’s long-term vision

Examples include:

- Conceptual clarifications
- Documentation improvements
- Design or UX refinements aligned with the philosophy
- Thoughtful technical proposals that preserve intent

---

## What We Do Not Accept

We do not accept contributions that:

- Introduce instant delivery or bypass waiting
- Optimize for speed, engagement, or retention metrics
- Add notification pressure or urgency
- Turn Escale into a social network or productivity tool
- Prioritize novelty over coherence
- Add features that cannot be expressed using Escale’s core language

Technical sophistication alone is not sufficient.  
Alignment with intention is mandatory.

## How to Propose a Contribution

1. **Open an issue first**  
   Describe your idea, intention, and how it aligns with Escale’s philosophy.

2. **Explain the “why” before the “how”**  
   What does this change preserve or improve conceptually?

3. **Be prepared for discussion**  
   Contributions may be declined if they compromise coherence, even if well implemented.

---

## Tone and Collaboration

Escale values calm, respectful, and thoughtful collaboration.

- No urgency
- No pressure
- No performative debate
- No growth-at-all-costs mindset

Disagreement is acceptable.  
Disruption of intention is not.

---

## Decision Process

Final decisions aim to preserve:

- conceptual clarity,
- ethical restraint,
- and long-term coherence.

Not every good idea belongs in Escale.

---

## A Shared Responsibility

Contributing to Escale means participating in a shared responsibility:
to protect a slower, more intentional form of digital communication.

If this resonates with you, you are welcome here.

Thank you for taking the time to contribute thoughtfully.
